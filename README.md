# **[Project 3: Restaurant review NLP: Project Overview]** 

For this project, I will create a Natural Language Processing ML model to predict whether the restaurant review from the customers is positive or negative.

-Users can use the model to make prediction by key in the sentences at the "Making prediction" cell, line 1. After that, run the 2 cells and the result will print out.
(0=negative, 1=positive)

## **Result:**

-The model recorded an accuracy of 73%.

It's consider as good result since stopwords such as "not" had been removed from the review and this might cause the inaccuracy of some prediction.
